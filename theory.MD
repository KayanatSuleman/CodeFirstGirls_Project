# TASK 3 (Exception Handling):

> Complete

# TASK 4 (Testing): Incomplete 
>
> Issues arisen with lack of practice in testing, the terminal won't run the test. I have made sure to use git ls to check the directories, used cat test_shop.py to call on the test_shop.py file, to ensure that gitpod is using the correct file to test. I've also made sure to check if Unittest is installed - which it is. I have also made sure that the file was saved before trying to run any tests. I am also not sure if I satisfied the marking criteria by using Gitpod to run the tests, but my Pycharm has been deactivated, and I do not have the necessary skills to run anything using VSCode until further notice.
